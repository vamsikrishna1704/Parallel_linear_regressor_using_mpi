# Parallel-Linear-Regression

Inorder to run this, please install MPI on your local machines and then follow the following steps:
- Install numpy package.
- Install matplotlib.
- Install scikit-learn.
- Install mpi4py.
- Please run them as they are, different hardware yields different output.

Sequential Code: LinearRegressionCali.py
Parallel Code: parallelCali.py
The above two files contain the absolute code, and rest of the notebooks act as experiments done during the development.
